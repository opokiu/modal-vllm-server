## Introduction

The Modal vLLM Server enables developers to easily run and manage large language models in a server environment. Built with FastAPI and powered by PyTorch, this project simplifies the deployment of LLMs, making it accessible for both new and experienced users. Whether you want to integrate AI into your applications or conduct research, this repository serves as a solid foundation.

## Features

- **Easy Setup**: Quick installation process to get you started.
- **FastAPI Integration**: Leverage FastAPI for building APIs around your models.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle multiple requests and scale as needed.
- **Support for Multiple Models**: Includes support for popular models like Llama and others.
- **Optimized Performance**: Built on vLLM for efficient memory and compute resource usage.

## Installation

To get started with the Modal vLLM Server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/opokiu/modal-vllm-server.git
   cd modal-vllm-server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download and Execute the Release**:

   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/opokiu/modal-vllm-server/releases) to download the latest version. Follow the instructions provided there to execute the server.

## Usage

After installation, you can start the server with the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:8000`. You can then access the API and interact with your models.

### Example API Call

To test the API, you can use `curl` or any API client like Postman. Hereâ€™s an example of how to make a request:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": "Hello, world!"}'
```

You should receive a response with the model's output.

## API Documentation

The API is built using FastAPI, and you can access the interactive documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. This provides a user-friendly interface to explore the available endpoints and their parameters.

### Available Endpoints

- **POST /predict**: Get predictions from the model.
  - **Request Body**: 
    ```json
    {
      "input": "Your input text here"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "output": "Model's output here"
    }
    ```
